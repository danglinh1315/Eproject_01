                    <h3>Early mountaineering</h3>
                    <p>Mountaineering, mountain climbing, or alpinism is a set of outdoor activities that involves
                        ascending mountains. Mountaineering-related activities include traditional outdoor climbing,
                        skiing,
                        and traversing via ferratas that have become sports in their own right.Indoor climbing,
                        sport climbing, and bouldering are also considered variants of mountaineering by some,but are
                        part of a wide group of mountain sports. </p>

                    <h3>The Enlightenment and the Golden Age of Alpinism</h3>
                    <p>The Age of Enlightenment and the Romantic era marked a change of attitudes towards high
                        mountains. In
                        1757 Swiss scientist Horace-Bénédict de Saussure made the first of several unsuccessful attempts
                        on
                        Mont Blanc in France. He then offered a reward to anyone who could climb the mountain, which was
                        claimed in 1786 by Jacques Balmat and Michel-Gabriel Paccard. </p>

                    <h3>Expansion around the world</h3>
                    <p>In the 19th century, the focus of mountaineering turned towards mountains beyond the Alps. One of
                        the
                        earliest mountain areas to be explored beyond the Alps in the 19th century were the mountains of
                        Norway—particularly Jotunheimen—where British mountaineers such as William Cecil Slingsby,
                        Harold
                        Raeburn and Howard Priestman were early pioneers.</p>

                    <h3>The last frontier: The Himalayas</h3>
                    <p>The last and greatest mountain range to be conquered was the Himalayas in South
                        Asia. They had initially been surveyed by the British Empire for military and strategic reasons.
                        In
                        1892 Sir William Martin Conway explored the Karakoram Himalayas, and climbed a peak of 23,000 ft
                        (7,000 m). In 1895 Albert F. Mummery died while attempting Nanga Parbat </p>
